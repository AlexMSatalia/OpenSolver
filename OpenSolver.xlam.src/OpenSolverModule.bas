' v0.2: Switched to Application.Calculation = manual; it is twice as fast. Looping thru the LHS and RHS ranges is an insignificant time when compared to the calculation time
'       Eg, Run time with no LHS and RHS range loopups is 4.2s, this goes to 4.4 or 4.5 when we loop thru the LHS and RHS ranges
'       Note: Reading cell values one by one is very slow.
